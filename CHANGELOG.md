# Changelog — Super Drop (fork of Bada)

All notable changes to this fork. Upstream Bada history is preserved in git;
entries here cover only fork-specific changes.

## [Unreleased]

### 2026-06-05
- Forked `kyujin-cho/Bada` at upstream HEAD `62d60f3` (release `20260604.02`).
- Renamed git remote `origin` → `upstream`; created working branch `fork/superdrop-ui`.
- Added `FORK_PLAN.md` documenting the two UI redesigns (send = bottom sheet from
  share sheet; receive = Quick Settings tile → bottom-sheet foreground activity),
  the exact tile↔visibility behavior, the planned app identity
  (`dev.peskoff.superdrop`, name "Super Drop"), and the interop-critical wire
  identifiers that must not be renamed.
- Renamed package `dev.bluehouse.bada` → `dev.superdrop` (all 5 modules: source dirs,
  package/import, 3 Gradle namespaces + applicationId + `.debug` suffix, 3 custom-View
  FQCNs in XML, Robolectric shadow ref), `rootProject.name`→`SuperDrop`, `app_name`→"Super Drop".
  Wire identifiers (`_FC9F5ED42C8A._tcp.`, `NearbySharing`, BLE UUIDs) left untouched.
  Verified: `:app:assembleDebug` BUILD SUCCESSFUL (JDK 17), app-debug.apk produced.
- Protocol/transport stack untouched.
